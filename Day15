exalt/exult
To exalt, means to glorify or elevate something, but to exult is to rejoice. Exalt your favorite pro-wrestler, Jesus, or your status in the world. Exult when you get the last two tickets to see your favorite band.



Exalt is a transitive verb, so it needs a direct object: you have to exalt something. If we glorify God, we exalt him. It can also mean to heighten something, to increase its effects. You can exalt, or raise something, like in these examples:

I'm afraid, though, that very few people walk on that exalted plane. (New York Times)

To exult (with a "u") is to whoop it up, celebrate, to be happy. If you rejoice at your team's big win, you exult in it. It's an intransitive verb, so it doesn't need an object â€” you exult all by yourself, any way you want:
