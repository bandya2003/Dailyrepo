sac/sack
Both are containers, but a sac is for plants and animals, and a sack is for a sandwich. So spiders put their eggs in a sac, and people put their groceries in a sack.

A sac is usually biological â€” attached to a living thing. At the end of E.B. White's, Charlotte's Web, Charlotte, the dying spider, says, "This is my egg sac, my magnum opus, my great work."

Sacs aren't just for spiders, though. Humans have them, too:

 "The identical twin girls shared an amniotic sac and placenta." (Washington Post)

"It damages air sacs and passages to the lungs, and can make breathing a struggle." (BBC)
