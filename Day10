allude/elude
Allude is coy, to allude is to refer to something in an indirect manner. But elude's favorite thing to do is hide from the cops; it means "to evade." Because the accent is on the second syllable in both words, it's easy to get them mixed up.


To allude is to talk around something, give hints, and generally not say what you really want to say. You allude to something when you don't want to say it outright:

In fact, McCarthy alluded to Williams as being an afterthought in Green Bay's game plan. 


To elude, on the other hand, is to get away. Elude does love hiding from the law, but it can also refer to an idea you can't grasp or cheap health care:

It was a secluded zone with no mobile telephone reception â€” perfect for eluding law enforcement snooping.
