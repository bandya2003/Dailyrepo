Extant is something that's still around â€” you're surprised it's not extinct. It's more than just existing but also surviving when others have not.

Example : He wrote in Latin an incorrect history of England, which is still extant. 


Extent (with an e) means the range of something. Extent can also refer to a degree of something, such as goal achievement. Extent is also the space something covers or takes up. You might see the phrase to a lesser extent (not as much), or greater extent (more). 

Example : One's tongue slips in a longer speech to such an extent that the last word of the intended speech is said too soon.
